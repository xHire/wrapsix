WrapSix
=======

About
-----
WrapSix is a fast NAT64 implementation. You also need a DNS64 server (e.g., BIND
or unbound).

Installation
------------
For installation use standard ./configure && make && make install commands.

Configuration
-------------
WrapSix uses configuration file wrapsix.conf from configuration directory set in
"./configure" phase, which is by default /usr/local/etc. You can also specify
custom configuration file in runtime -- just pass its path as an argument:

# wrapsix ./wrapsix.conf

Pay attention to the IPv4 address. If you assign IP address that is already
controlled by your OS, TCP won't work (OS will terminate all connection
attempts).

Also, IPv4 is a little bit tricky. To ease both configuration and implementation
as much as possible, WrapSix leverages configuration for IPv4 already present in
the operating system. Therefore to work, IPv4 needs to be functional on the OS
level.

Running
-------
It can be run by `wrapsix` command as root.

Please note that traffic originating from the host WrapSix runs on cannot be
translated since WrapSix listens for incoming packets on the interface itself.
Therefore, you need some other host for testing it. The easiest way to route
traffic to the host running wrapsix is to setup static route. Assuming the
wrapsix host is assinged '2001:470:eb27::dd' and you're using the default
prefix '64:ff9b::/96', you can add a route on the client host like this:
'ip -f inet6 route add 64:ff9b::/96 via 2001:470:eb27::11'

If WrapSix doesn't seem to be working, ensure (e.g., with tcpdump) that you
have correctly configured routing in your network.
